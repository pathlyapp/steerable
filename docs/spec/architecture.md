# Architecture (Tier 1 → Tier 5)

Steerable is intentionally **layered**. Each tier has a single
responsibility and a small surface, so consumers can swap or replace any
layer without leaking concerns into the layers above and below.

## Why five tiers, not "an SDK"

Most agent frameworks ship a monolithic SDK that bundles wire types,
prompt construction, tool execution, storage, and React widgets into one
package. That makes the smallest examples fit on a slide — but couples
upgrades and forces you to take all-or-nothing dependencies. Steerable
splits the five concerns that change at very different rates:

| Tier | Changes when…                                | Versioning impact          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1    | Wire protocol evolves (new event type, etc.) | Lock-step npm + PyPI bump  |
| 2    | Harness rule changes (new policy mode, etc.) | PyPI bump (TS facade auto) |
| 3    | Runtime adapter added (new LLM provider)     | Independent PyPI bump      |
| 4    | UI components added / refactored             | Independent npm bump       |
| 5    | Host shell gains a product surface           | Lock-step npm bump (public) |

## Tier 1 — Protocol

**Packages:** `@steerable/agent-protocol` · `steerable-agent-protocol`

Pure data types. No I/O, no logic, no LLM client code. Defined in JSON
Schema under `spec/`, codegen produces:

- TypeScript: `interface`s + Zod validators
- Python: `pydantic.BaseModel` classes

Drift between the two SDKs is **detected by CI** (`scripts/check_ts_drift.mjs`
+ `scripts/check_drift.py`) so a change to the schema can never produce
inconsistent types in production.

Lock-step version — both SDKs always release at the same version.

## Tier 2 — Harness

**Packages:** `steerable-agent-harness` (Python — source of truth) ·
`@steerable/agent-harness` (TypeScript — thin parity facade)

Pure functions over Tier 1 types. No I/O, no I/O-adjacent state. Topics
covered:

- `policy.decide_tool_mode(name)` — read / safe_write / destructive / local
- `budget.consume_budget(...)` — token / step / tool-call accounting
- `retry.next_retry_delay_ms(...)` — exponential-backoff helpers
- `completion.is_terminal_result(...)` — should the loop stop?
- `tracing.TraceSpan` — span data structure (storage is Tier 3)
- `safety_patterns.classify_shell_command(...)` — shell command risk grading

Python is canonical because the harness is consumed by server and sidecar
runtimes. The TypeScript facade exists so cross-language conformance
tests can verify both SDKs answer identically against the
`tests/conformance/cases/` golden inputs — but no production TS code
needs the harness directly today.

## Tier 3 — Runtime

**Package:** `steerable-agent-runtime` (Python only)

Adapter interfaces and reference implementations:

| Interface           | Reference implementations            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `LLMProvider`       | `OpenAICompatProvider` (covers OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, DeepSeek, Groq, …), `OpenAIResponsesProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`, `GoogleGenAIProvider` |
| `ToolRouter`        | In-process registry with `@tool`     |
| `StorageAdapter`    | `InMemoryStorage`, `SqlAlchemyStorage` |
| `TransportAdapter`  | `FastAPISseTransport`, `StdioJsonRpcTransport` |

Tier 3 exposes the production **`CoreLoop`** facade backed by the pinned native engine — the
single-agent think → act → observe step loop with its structured
`LoopEvent` taxonomy (15 kinds), pseudo tool-call recovery, compaction,
approval/sandbox executor decorators, subagent pool, and MCP client.
Multi-agent planning, DAGs, and groupchat stay **above** the loop: the
framework provides the loop and the primitives; product-level
orchestration semantics remain your business logic. See the
[CoreLoop spec](core-loop.md).

## Tier 3 — Sidecar (executable)

**Package:** `steerable-sidecar` (Python executable, packaged as portable
CPython via `python-build-standalone`)

A pre-wired JSON-RPC server that composes Tier 1 + 2 + 3 into an executable
that any UI shell can spawn. Wire format documented at
[Sidecar spec](sidecar.md). Desktop and headless hosts can use the same
runtime without duplicating agent business logic.

Bundle size: < 300 MB per platform after stdlib stripping (CI enforced).

## Tier 4 — UI

**Package:** `@steerable/agent-ui`

Headless React hooks + components, Tailwind preset. Designed so a single
React tree can mount either:

- a transport that hits HTTP+SSE (web app)
- a transport that uses Electron IPC bridged to the sidecar (desktop)

without any component-level changes.

## Tier 5 — Host Shell

**Packages:** `@steerable/agent-shell` · `@steerable/agent-shell-web` ·
`@steerable/pack-sdk` — versioned in lockstep and **published to npm** so
product repos can pin semantic versions. `agent-shell` ships its compiled
`dist/`; `agent-shell-web` ships its `src/` (products compile it via the
`createProductViteConfig` factory and the `@/` alias); `pack-sdk` ships pure
`types/` (zero runtime). Products may still use source/`link:` during local
development.

The assemble-a-product tier: an Electron desktop shell (main process, IPC,
strict CSP, visible PTY) and a headless HTTP server (`/api/v2/*`, SSE) built
from the same `HostRuntime`; a local backend (chat/project/agent CRUD,
CoreLoop streaming, skill loader, subagent profiles, worktree service,
background tasks, usage/insights storage); sidecar supervision (boot, health,
egress proxy, exec sandbox, reverse approval/ask-user bridges); and a
product-neutral renderer SPA. Brand, telemetry endpoints, help links, and
data-directory names are injected by the consuming product's assembly root —
the `shell:neutral` CI gate fails on any product hardcoding in shell sources.

Tier 5 is how [DeepPath](https://deeppath.cc) ships its desktop app, and it
runs standalone for evaluation: `pnpm agent-shell:web` (headless server +
neutral web app) or `pnpm agent-shell:client` (Electron window).

## Why one Python sidecar facade

The split avoids maintaining duplicate business logic:

1. The web app and the FastAPI server already shared the protocol types.
2. The desktop app needed to share **business logic**, not just types.
3. Maintaining two implementations of policy/budget/retry/tools/storage
   in TS+Py guaranteed drift.
4. Embedding a portable Python sidecar in Electron lets the desktop app
   call the same harness + runtime the server uses, with zero drift.

The Python sidecar owns the complete Tier 2 / 3 API and business behavior.
Rust owns the CoreLoop execution engine loaded through the native bridge; it
is not a second sidecar implementation.

### Official TS production entry: the embedded-sidecar runtime

Python is the only production sidecar implementation. Rust is the only
production CoreLoop implementation. There is no TS CoreLoop or standalone
Rust sidecar product path — either would recreate the drift trap this
architecture exists to avoid. The supported way for a
pure-TypeScript product to run the framework in production is
`@steerable/agent-runtime` (`packages/agent-runtime/ts`): an official
runtime package that owns the sidecar process lifecycle (spawn,
`lifecycle.ready` handshake, health ping, bounded auto-restart, graceful
drain) and exposes CoreLoop-level API — chat stream/cancel/steer,
session create/resume/list/fork/branches, tool list/invoke, skills,
workspace edits, trace, config — over the same JSON-RPC method surface
documented in [sidecar.md](./sidecar.md). Callers get the framework;
they never write subprocess management. Because the TS runtime drives
the same Rust CoreLoop through the Python sidecar facade, cross-language
conformance holds by construction; a test gates that the TS API surface
covers every method the sidecar registers.
